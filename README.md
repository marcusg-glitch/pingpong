# pingpong
a classic pingpong game with two sides. I chose the winning settings to be the one who reaches five points first. when the first side reaches four points the ball turns red to alert everyone in the game extra, should the opponent catch up to four points too the ball turns blue. at 0-0 there is a 3,2,1 countdown timer and the game repeats itself.
left player uses W and S keys and right player plays with uparrow and downarrow.
ball increases in speed by 25% for each five second incrament.
